# atlas-core

Central programming repository.

This repository contains systems, tools, experiments, and documentation developed as part of long-term programming practice and skill development.

## Scope

- Reusable tools and internal utilities  
- Experimental code and prototypes  
- Larger programming projects  
- Technical notes and design references  

Content is primarily exploratory and may be incomplete or unstable.

## Structure

The structure may change over time. Typical directories include:

- `experiments/` — prototypes and tests  
- `tools/` — internal tooling and utilities  
- `projects/` — larger codebases  
- `docs/` — technical documentation and notes  

## Principles

- Build to understand  
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness  
- Optimize for learning and maintainability  
- Accept iteration and refactoring  

## Status

Active and evolving. No guarantees of stability.
